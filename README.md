### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ A litte bit about me:

My name is Eron Lake. I was born and raised in  San Jose, California, though both of my parents are from Guyana (South America) and was actually homeschooled by my mom and grandmother for the early part of my schooling. I graduated from the University of California Santa Cruz with a double major in Computer Science and CS: Game Design, where I designed a led a Game team of 20+! 

Since then I have been working full-time at Verizon Media/Yahoo Sports as a Back-End Software Engineer. On the side, I have worked as a Gameplay Programmer with a number if indie teams.

Outside of that, I am big into the arts. I spend most of my free time singing, playing music, dancing, reading, writing, or watching the latest TV show or Movie to be released. Also a must note, is that I am a huge comic book nerd, so Iâ€™m your guy if you ever want to think deeply about Batman!  

Pronouns: He/Him/His
